                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>One of the main challenges I faced while creating the Ember Echo website was ensuring accessibility for all users, particularly for those with disabilities. This required careful consideration of color contrast, image alt texts, and clear navigation. I also faced difficulties in making the website fully responsive across different devices and screen sizes. However, through these challenges, I learned the importance of user-centered design and the value of adhering to web accessibility standards. I also gained practical experience in applying responsive design techniques and understanding web security best practices to create a safer, more inclusive online experience.</p>

                    <p>The Ember Echo website complies with the Janet regulations governing web page publication by ensuring it meets the necessary accessibility standards and adheres to legal and ethical guidelines. This includes providing clear navigation, alt text for images, and ensuring color contrast is appropriate for users with visual impairments. The website follows best practices for data protection and privacy by avoiding the collection of unnecessary personal data and ensuring that any user data is handled securely. Additionally, I have made the site responsive to accommodate different devices and screen sizes, which aligns with accessibility requirements. Through these efforts, the website ensures a compliant and user-friendly experience for all visitors.</p>
