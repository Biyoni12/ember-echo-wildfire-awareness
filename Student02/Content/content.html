            <div class="overview">
                <p >The 2025 wildfire in America, particularly in California, was one of the most devastating natural disasters in recent history. It began in January 2025, defying the typical wildfire season, and rapidly spread across Southern California due to extreme weather conditions and drought. 
                    This page focuses on the causes of the wildfire and how it started and spread.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>How the Wildfire Started</h2>
                <p>The first fire started in the Pacific Palisades neighbourhood of Los Angeles at 10:30am on Tuesday, January 7, 2025, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). While the exact trigger is still under investigation, several factors contributed to the initial outbreak:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Uncontrolled Small Fire:</strong> 
                    A persistent theory suggests that a small fire on January 1 was never fully extinguished and reignited six days later as winds picked up. 
                    This small fire smoldered unnoticed until strong winds fanned the flames, causing it to grow rapidly.</li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Dry Conditions:</strong> 
                    Southern California had been experiencing severe drought conditions, with only 40.9% of the state drought-free as of December 31, 2024. 
                    The lack of rainfall dehydrated vegetation, making it highly flammable and providing ample fuel for the fire.</li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Santa Ana Winds:</strong> 
                    These dry and hot winds, common in the area, significantly reduced humidity and fanned the flames, creating ideal conditions for a wildfire. 
                    The winds also carried embers over long distances, igniting new fires ahead of the main blaze.</li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Human Activity:</strong> 
                    Flammable materials such as low-hanging power cables and wooden telephone poles in the area may have contributed to the fire's ignition. 
                    Human negligence, such as improperly extinguished campfires or discarded cigarette butts, could also have played a role.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Kai Cranmore and his friends, hiking in Temescal Canyon on the morning of January 7, were among the first to notice the fire. In videos posted online, they are seen running down the canyon as a small cloud of smoke billows from a hill. 
                    They reported smelling fire before seeing the smoke, indicating the fire may have started earlier than officially reported.</p>
                <p>A security guard working near the trail also reported seeing smoke or dust for several days before the blaze. On the morning of the fire, he called firefighters as a plume of smoke formed in the canyon.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>How the Wildfire Spread</h2>
                <p>The Palisades Fire, which started in Temescal Canyon, spread rapidly due to a combination of natural and human factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Santa Ana Winds:</strong> 
                        These near-hurricane force winds carried embers far ahead of the main fire, igniting new spots and creating multiple fire fronts. 
                        The winds also dehydrated vegetation, making it easier for the fire to spread.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dry Vegetation:</strong> 
                        The lack of rainfall and prolonged drought left the landscape tinder-dry, providing ample fuel for the fire to grow. 
                        The dry grass, shrubs, and trees burned quickly, allowing the fire to spread at an alarming rate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Urban Conflagration:</strong> 
                        The fire spread not only through natural vegetation but also through urban areas. Embers ignited structures, and the fire leaped from building to building, creating a massive urban conflagration. 
                        This made containment efforts extremely difficult.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple Ignition Points:</strong> 
                        Within hours of the Palisades Fire, additional fires broke out in Eaton, Sylmar, and other parts of California, overwhelming firefighting resources. 
                        These multiple ignition points made it nearly impossible to control the spread of the fire.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Experts described the situation as unprecedented. Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA, noted that the combination of abundant dry vegetation and extreme winds created a "perfect storm" for the fire to spread uncontrollably.</p>

                <h2>Impacts of the Wildfire</h2>
                <p>While the primary focus of this page is on the causes of the wildfire, it is important to acknowledge some of the significant impacts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Destruction of Property:</strong> Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed, leaving many families homeless and causing billions of dollars in damages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Displacement of Communities:</strong> Entire neighborhoods were evacuated, displacing thousands of residents and creating a humanitarian crisis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Environmental Damage:</strong> The wildfire caused extensive damage to ecosystems, destroying wildlife habitats and releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</li>
                    <li id="5"><strong>Health Risks:</strong> The smoke and ash from the fire created hazardous air quality, leading to respiratory issues and other health problems for residents in the affected areas.</li>
                </ul>
