                <h3>Technical Implementation:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Developed a responsive navigation bar using semantic HTML5 tags like nav and styled it with CSS to ensure seamless navigation to all pages.</li>
                    <li>Integrated images to visually represent evidence and key content, ensuring they are optimized for fast loading and accessibility with descriptive alt attributes.</li>
                    <li>Implemented flexboxes to create a dynamic and flexible layout for content sections. Each flexbox contains buttons that, when clicked, redirect users to the corresponding content pages.</li>
                    <li>Designed Interactive buttons (e.g., "Learn More" and "Join Us") with hover effects using CSS transitions.</li>
                    <li>Applied consistent padding, margins, and text alignment throughout the page to ensure a clean and organized layout.</li>
                    <li>Used a well-thought-out color scheme to create a visually cohesive design throughout the whole page.</li>
                </ul>
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>
                        The homepage prioritize accessibility with semantic HTML5 tags, such as nav, header, and main, were used to improve screen reader compatibility and provide a clear structure. 
                        A attributes were added to interactive elements, such as buttons and navigation links, to provide additional context for assistive technologies. 
                        Proper navigation was implemented to ensure all features, including the navigation bar and flexbox buttons. 
                        Proper colors and scalable fonts were used to make the page readable for users with visual impairments. 
                        Additionally, all images include descriptive alt text to ensure they are accessible to screen reader users. 
                    </p>

                <h2 id="table">Table Page</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designed a responsive and interactive table using semantic HTML tags like th, tr, and td to ensure proper structure and accessibility.</li>
                    <li>Added cell padding, borders, and alternating row colors to improve readability and visual appeal.</li>
                    <li>Implemented navigation links within the table cells allowing users to seamlessly navigate to related content pages.</li>
                    <li>Styled the table with proper CSS to ensure it adapts to different screen sizes, making it responsive.</li>
                    <li>Used hover effects on table rows to enhance interactivity and user engagement.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>
                    To guarantee the table is available to every user, I integrated multiple essential features. 
                    The table employs semantic HTML tags and attributes to establish row and column headers, facilitating a simpler interpretation of the data by screen readers. 
                    <br>I included a attributes for navigation links in the table to enhance context. 
                    For instance, when a user selects a link, it directs them to the appropriate content page, and hover effects are incorporated to visually signify interactivity. 
                    The table is also crafted for seamless scrolling, featuring well-padded cells and text aligned for better readability. 
                    Table titles are clearly shown and stay in view while scrolling to preserve context. These features ensure that the table is inclusive, easy to use, and accessible.

                <ul>
                    <li>Structured the page using semantic HTML5 tags like header, main and footer for clear and accessible content organization.</li>
                    <li>Added interactive images with hover effects and embedded reference links to external websites for additional information.</li>
                    <li>Implemented page navigation using the id attribute, allowing users to jump to specific sections without scrolling.</li>

                    The content page was designed with accessibility in mind. 
                    Semantic HTML5 tags and ARIA attributes were used to improve screen reader compatibility. 
                    Interactive elements, such as images and links, include descriptive text for clarity. 
                    The "Back to Top" button and page navigation ensure keyboard accessibility, while high-contrast colors and scalable fonts make the page usable for individuals with visual impairments.

                <h2 id="challenge">Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges was making the webpage <strong>fully responsive</strong>. Ensuring that the layout adapted seamlessly to different screen sizes required extensive use of CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries. 
                    Testing each value for <strong>proper padding and margins</strong> was time-consuming but necessary to achieve a polished and aligned design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another significant challenge was <strong>designing the webpage</strong> itself. 
                    Deciding on a layout that was both visually appealing and functional took considerable effort. 
                    Choosing the <strong>right color scheme</strong>, especially for the homepage, was also difficult, as it required balancing aesthetics with accessibility and consistency across all pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the <strong>Table Page</strong>, creating a responsive table with proper cell padding and alignment was particularly challenging. 
                    Ensuring that the table looked good on all devices while maintaining readability and functionality required multiple iterations and testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These challenges taught me the importance of <strong>planning ahead</strong>, <strong>testing thoroughly</strong>, and being patient with the design process. 
                    I learned that small details, like padding and color choices, can significantly impact the overall user experience, and that responsiveness is key to creating a modern, user-friendly website.

                <p>
                    The pages follow Janet rules, making sure the network is safe and used. Semantic HTML5, ARIA attributes, and high-contrast designs are easy to see, while responsive layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox ensure usability across devices. 
                    Code validation and following web rules show the pages meet technical needs. Additionally, things like easy navigation and clear picture descriptions match Janet's goal to include everyone, ensuring the pages are accessible and safe for all users.
