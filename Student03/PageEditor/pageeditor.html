                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>
                    The Feedback Page was developed using semantic HTML5 and CSS3, ensuring a clean and accessible layout. Key HTML tags such as <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> were used to create an interactive feedback form. 
                    CSS was utilized to style the form, including hover effects, transitions, and responsive design to ensure compatibility across devices. The form includes various input types such as text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, and emoji-based rating scales to enhance user interaction.
                </p>
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>
                    Accessibility was a priority in the design of the Feedback Page. All form fields are labeled with <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> tags, and ARIA attributes were used where necessary to improve screen reader compatibility. 
                    The page follows a logical heading hierarchy, and sufficient contrast was maintained between text and background colors to ensure readability for all users.

                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>
                    The Team Page was designed to showcase the members of the development team. It uses a responsive grid layout created with CSS Flexbox, ensuring that the page adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. Each team member's profile includes an image, name, role, and an expandable section with additional details. Hover effects and smooth transitions were added to enhance user interaction and visual appeal.
                </p>
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>
                    The Team Page was built with accessibility in mind. All images include descriptive <code>alt</code> attributes, and the expandable sections are keyboard-navigable. The page follows a clear heading structure, and the use of ARIA roles ensures compatibility with screen readers. The color scheme was chosen to provide sufficient contrast for users with visual impairments.

                <p>
                    The Feedback Section in the Content Page was designed to display user feedback from various platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, and Truth Social. The section uses a card-based layout with hover effects and transitions to create an engaging user experience. Each feedback item includes details such as the platform, date, and commenter, along with a visual icon to represent the source of the feedback.
                </p>
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>
                    Accessibility was considered in the design of the Feedback Section. Each feedback item is clearly labeled, and the use of semantic HTML ensures that the content is easily navigable by screen readers. The section also includes a responsive image grid with captions, ensuring that all users can access the visual content.

                <h2 id="challenge">Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the development of the "Ember Echo" website, several challenges were encountered that required problem-solving and adaptation to ensure a seamless user experience. Below are some of the key challenges and the lessons learned from them:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Ensuring that the Feedback Page and Team Page were fully responsive across different devices was a significant challenge. This required careful use of CSS Flexbox and media queries to adapt the layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.</li>
                        <li><strong>Form Validation:</strong> Implementing client-side validation for the Feedback Page form was challenging, especially ensuring that all fields were validated correctly without compromising user experience. This taught me the importance of clear error messages and user-friendly form design.</li>
                        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Making the Team Page and Feedback Section accessible to all users, including those using screen readers, required careful attention to semantic HTML and ARIA attributes. This experience highlighted the importance of accessibility in web design.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cross-Browser Compatibility:</strong> Ensuring that the Feedback Page and Team Page worked consistently across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) was a challenge. This taught me the importance of testing and debugging across multiple platforms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Content Organization:</strong> Organizing the feedback data in the Content Page in a visually appealing and user-friendly way was challenging. This experience improved my skills in CSS Grid and Flexbox for creating structured layouts.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 id="compliance">Compliance</h2>
                <p>
                    The Feedback Page, Team Page, and Feedback Section in the Content Page adhere to standard web development practices and comply with W3C HTML5 and CSS3 standards. Semantic HTML elements such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> were used to ensure proper document structure and accessibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accessibility was a key focus during development. All forms on the Feedback Page include descriptive labels, and the Team Page features expandable sections that are keyboard-navigable. The Feedback Section in the Content Page includes alt text for all images and follows a logical heading hierarchy to assist screen readers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pages are fully responsive, utilizing CSS Flexbox and media queries to ensure compatibility across various devices and screen sizes. HTML and CSS validation checks were performed to maintain code quality, and no copyrighted content was used without permission, ensuring compliance with ethical and legal standards.
                </p>
